# bobgl-rewritten
Bobgl. Inspired by an earlier game I made using Unity called Bobcraft but this time I challenged myself to do it more barebones which resulted in more features and "visual" effects. As you could probably tell bobcraft is a Minecraft clone.
Stitched together with ducktape.
Not the best code I've written. Not packed with features but at some point you could build and place blocks. This is written a lot later than the latest push so not sure at the final product.
